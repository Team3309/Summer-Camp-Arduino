// Sample Code to navigate around an obstacle

// 2013 Friarbots Summer Camp

// These #include statements load the external 
// Motor Sheild and Ultrasonic sensor libraries.

// These #define statements make it easier to specify
// once what pins are being used for the sonar sensor
// rather than having to hunt for and replace them
// in the code.  For our purposes, they shouldn't
// have to be changed as all the boards should be
// wired up the same.

// This initializes the sonar sensor plugged into the pins
// as defined above.

// to inputs other than 1 and 2, be sure to change the values
// in parenthesis.
